## Todo

- [x] Figure out a way to handle artwork_url processing times
- [ ] Send notification when previous track amount = 0
- [x] Find out if there is a way to upload music stream to discord
- [x] Add client based custom artist lists to check (with commands) [**IMPORTANT**]
  - Seperate and store each user lists of specific servers using server IDs
  - Make use of SQLite3 somehow to store and organize data
- [x] URL/Artist UserID as input instead of user ID, then convert to user ID and store in DB
- [x] Better handling for commands and change to shorter commands (length)
- [ ] Fix art_url retrieving as NULL -- add handling and await when art is processing
